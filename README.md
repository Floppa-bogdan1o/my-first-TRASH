# my-first-TRASH
Random code snippets from my journey to becoming a programmer.  
⚠️ Not recommended for serious use — it's just for fun, experiments, and memes.  

# What do we have?
- 1 My first CMD project in CPP
- 2 Calorie calculator based on QT (camelator 1k kg🐪)

## Why this repo exists
- To dump my chaotic learning attempts
- To track progress (and cringe later 😅)
- To share silly code with the world

## Is this my exact code?

Projects don't use ready-made pieces of code from AI/Github/Stack Overflow and similar quick solutions 😛

## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk. Expect bugs, spaghetti code, and questionable decisions.
