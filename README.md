# my-first-TRASH
Random code snippets from my journey to becoming a programmer.  
⚠️ Not recommended for serious use — it's just for fun, experiments, and memes.  

## Why this repo exists
- To dump my chaotic learning attempts
- To track progress (and cringe later 😅)
- To share silly code with the world

## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk. Expect bugs, spaghetti code, and questionable decisions.
